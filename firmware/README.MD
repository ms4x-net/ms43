# Siemens MS43 Firmware Files 430069
**Notes:**
- The E39 5-series was already out of production when MS430069 was published, so we ported over the calibration data from 66 to the 69 code base.
- The E36/7 Z3-series was already out of production when MS430069 was published, so we ported over the calibration data from 66 to the 69 code base.
- There are no factory 2.8L calibrations for MS43, so we created one ourselves from MS42 and an early MS45.0 prototype calibration.
